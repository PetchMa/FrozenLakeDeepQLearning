A quick simple implementation of Deep Q learning with the help of OpenAI's gym. 
# Frozen Lake Game 
Super simple game where the agent can move up down, left and right on a lake where there is ice and holes. If they agents lands in a hole they die, and the objective is to make it to the end of the game. However, the movements are stochastic, meaning not all moves actually happen (for example theres a probability that going right will make the agent actually move up, slight randomness).
